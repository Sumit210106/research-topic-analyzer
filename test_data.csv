704.0004,A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic\n single-source automata,We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic\nsingle-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to\ncertain marked lattice paths and a s...,math.CO
